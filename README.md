A python package for complex, multi-component hyperfine spectra fitting in astronomical data.

## Installation

* McFine is pip installable

```shell
$ pip install mcfine
```

Or if you want to also use the RT capabilities:

```shell
$ pip install git+https://github.com/astropenguin/ndradex.git
```

Please note that for now RT capabilities are untested, and will be updated in future versions

## Documentation

Full documentation is available at https://mcfine.readthedocs.io, along with some examples and
demonstrations of features.

A more philosophical introduction to McFine is presented in Williams & Watkins (2024), along with some tests of how
well the code performs in synthetic tests and on real life space data.
